      "(The 20th Annual American High School Mathematics Examination, 1969)<|end|><|start|>assistant<|message|>Okay, let's see. The problem is asking about the number of points that are equidistant from both a circle and its two parallel tangents. The options are from 0 to infinitely many. Hmm. I need to visualize this first.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, imagine a circle. Let me recall that a tangent to a circle is a line that touches the circle at exactly one point. If there are two parallel tangents, then the circle must be between these two lines, right? Since parallel lines never meet, the distance between them must be twice the radius of the circle. Wait, is that true?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no. If the circle is in between two parallel tangent lines, then the distance between the two lines would be twice the diameter, right? Because the tangent lines are each a distance of the radius away from the center, but on opposite sides. Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me sketch this in my mind. Suppose the circle has center O and radius r. The two parallel tangent lines must be on opposite sides of the circle. For a circle, the distance from the center to a tangent line is equal to the radius. So, if there are two parallel tangents, one on each side of the circle, then the distance between these two lines is 2r. Because each tangent is r distance away from the center, and since they're parallel, the total distance between them is 2r. Got that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the question is about points equidistant from the circle and both of these two parallel tangents. Wait, equidistant from the circle and both tangents? Wait, the points must be equidistant to the circle and to each of the two tangent lines? Or equidistant to the circle and to both tangents collectively? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous, but I think it's equidistant to the circle and to both of the two parallel tangents. Wait, that might not make sense. Because the two tangents are on opposite sides of the circle, so a point can't be equidistant to both tangents unless it's somewhere between them. But the circle is in between them. So maybe the problem is asking for points that are equidistant to the circle and to each of the two tangents. Wait, that might not be possible. Let me parse the question again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The number of points that are equidistant from both a circle and its two parallel tangents is...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, \"equidistant from both a circle and its two parallel tangents.\" So, the point is equidistant from the circle and from both of the two parallel tangents. So, the point must have equal distance to the circle and to each tangent line? Wait, but the two tangent lines are parallel, so a point equidistant to both tangents would lie on the line midway between them. Since the distance between the tangents is 2r, the midway line is at distance r from each tangent, which is the same as the radius. Wait, so the center of the circle is on this midway line, and the distance from the center to each tangent is r. But the circle itself is at radius r from the center, so points on the circle are at distance zero from the circle (since they are on it) and distance r from the tangent lines. But the problem is asking for points equidistant from the circle and the two tangents. Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the points need to be equidistant to the circle and to both tangent lines. So, the distance from the point to the circle is equal to the distance from the point to each tangent line. Wait, but the distance from a point to a circle is the minimal distance to the circle, which would be |distance from point to center minus radius|. Whereas the distance from the point to each tangent line is a fixed value if the point is equidistant to both tangents. Let me formalize this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me set up a coordinate system. Let's assume the circle is centered at (0, 0) with radius r. The two parallel tangent lines would then be horizontal lines y = r and y = -r, since the distance from the center to each tangent is r. Wait, but if the circle is centered at (0,0), then the horizontal tangents would be y = r and y = -r. The distance between these two lines is 2r.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we need to find points equidistant from the circle and both tangents. Since the two tangents are y = r and y = -r, the set of points equidistant from both tangents would lie on the lines midway between them. The midway line between y = r and y = -r is y = 0, which is the x-axis. So, any point equidistant from both tangents must lie on the x-axis.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we also need these points to be equidistant from the circle. The distance from a point (x, 0) on the x-axis to the circle would be the minimal distance from (x, 0) to any point on the circle. The minimal distance is |distance from (x,0) to the center (0,0) minus the radius|. The distance from (x,0) to the center is |x|. So, the minimal distance to the circle is ||x| - r|.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, the distance from (x,0) to each tangent line y = r and y = -r is r, since the vertical distance from (x,0) to y = r is r, and similarly to y = -r is also r. Wait, but if the point is on the x-axis, then the distance to both tangents is r. So, the distance from any point on the x-axis to the two tangents is always r. Therefore, we need points on the x-axis where the distance to the circle is also r.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, set ||x| - r| = r. Let's solve this equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 1: |x| - r = r => |x| = 2r. So, x = 2r or x = -2r.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 2: -(|x| - r) = r => -|x| + r = r => -|x| = 0 => |x| = 0. So, x = 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the points on the x-axis that are equidistant from the circle and the two tangents are at (2r, 0), (-2r, 0), and (0,0). So, three points. Therefore, the answer is C) 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but let me verify. The point (0,0) is the center. The distance from (0,0) to the circle is the radius r (since the center is inside the circle, the minimal distance to the circle would be r - 0 = r). The distance from (0,0) to each tangent is r. So, yes, (0,0) is equidistant to the circle and the tangents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The points (2r, 0) and (-2r, 0) are outside the circle. The distance from (2r, 0) to the circle is |2r - r| = r. The distance to each tangent is r. Similarly for (-2r, 0). So those three points satisfy the condition. Therefore, the answer should be 3, which is option C.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me check again. Maybe there are more points. Wait, the problem says \"points equidistant from both a circle and its two parallel tangents\". So, the points must be equidistant to the circle and to both tangents. But in our analysis, we restricted to points on the x-axis, since they have to be equidistant to both tangents. Because the two tangents are parallel and on opposite sides, the set of points equidistant to both is the midline between them, which is the x-axis. Therefore, all candidate points must lie on the x-axis. Then, on the x-axis, we found three points: center and two points at distance 2r from the center.\n",
      "\n",

Similarly, a point below the x-axis would be closer to the lower tangent. Therefore, the only points equidistant to both tangents are on the x-axis. So, indeed, the only possible points are on the x-axis. Therefore, we only need to consider points on the x-axis. And there we found three points. So, the answer should be C) 3.\n",
